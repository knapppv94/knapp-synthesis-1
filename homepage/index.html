            <p class="tab">Speech analysis has been used throughout history to help citizens understand the political leanings of their leaders. With the recent accusations by the news media that our new president, Donald Trump, has fascist beliefs, I decided to try and uncover the truth for myself. For my Synthesis One project, I chose to examine potentially fascist rhetoric that appears in the speeches of four well-known political leaders: Francisco Franco, Benito Mussolini, Adolf Hitler, and Donald Trump. To accomplish this, I chose to create two types of visual elements. One, pictured below, is a lexical dispersion plot of key terms found throughout a speech corpora of each of the four leaders. My other visual element is a word cloud. Each cloud shows key words used by each of the political leaders with the largest being the most frequent. To eliminate the possibility of stopwords or non-political words overwhelming each cloud, I first created lists of tokens not found in the XKCD Simple Word List, which is linked <a href="https://blog.xkcd.com/2015/09/22/a-thing-explainer-word-checker/">here</a>. To see my thoughts on each of the word clouds, see the linked pages above.</p>
            <p class="tab">I created the lexical dispersion plots below in order to show the frequency with which each leader used certain key terms that could be associated with fascism. Each line on the chart represents an instance of the key term on the left, and they are ordered in the manner of the text file on which they are based. As you can see, each leader mentioned his respective country with a very high frequency. This is corroborated by the word clouds; the name of the country or adjective where the politician leads is the largest word by far. However, I was also pleased to see a correlation between all leaders and the use of the word ‘nation.’ Nation building, after all, is one of the main goals of fascism.</p>
            <p class="tab">By looking at these charts, I expect that my audience will be able to see similarities between the speaking styles of each of the aforementioned leaders and be able to draw some loose conclusions about Donald Trump’s political beliefs. However, this project is only the beginning. As more statements and speeches are given, the data will only become more powerful in helping analysts understand his true ideology.</p>
            <p class="tab">Please click through the menu above to view the word clouds I have assembled for each leader.</p>
