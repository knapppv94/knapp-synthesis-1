            <p class="tab">Trump mentions his own country (‘America’) a great deal in his speeches, as well as the terms ‘deal’, ‘border’, ‘nation’ and ‘immigration’, all of which seem in line with the ideology of the other three leaders. That being said, many of the most frequent words in this cloud differ from those in the other leaders’ clouds. For example, Trump is the only leader to have both his first and last name appear in his word cloud, indicating that he is referring to himself in the third person. (See the top left and top right for evidence.) However, this could also indicate self-obsession, a quality that is quite prevalent in all of the fascist leaders. Overall, further analysis is definitely needed before a true comparison between all fascist leaders can be drawn.
